## Introduction
For this capstone project, I worked with a hypothetical client Chief Brand officer and the Lululemon marketing department. They're launching an aggressive global marketing campaign on all social media platforms promoting and attracting new customers that may feel intimidated to start practicing yoga in theyâ€™re studio or in general incentivising a reward system for any individual submitting photos of themselves with five specific yoga poses that Lululemon requires. This will also provide clarity to someone that has limited to no knowledge of yoga poses. They can also provide examples of how a pose is done from other peoples images creating a social network. They can also use this data as customer engagement. Providing accuracy, if they are doing the poses correctly or not. They are expecting an enormous feed back that would reqiure alot of time and employee efficiency.

## Business Objective
Our goal is to create a multi image classification model by using artificial intelligence algorithms, a multi-layer Convolutional Neural Network that can identify five different yoga poses these poses are downward dog ,tree pose, plank pose, goddess pose and the warrior two pose. The model output from this project can be used to identify yoga poses and gain reliable data.

## Data Understanding
The data used was from Kaggle,([you can find it here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niharika41298/yoga-poses-dataset) )a yoga pose data set. That consist of 1550 images with Rgb color values with an alpha channel which specifies the opacity for a color. We analyze 1550 still images from 5 image classes to create a multi-image classification model that would help their marketing department correctly identify image classes. With our analysis and modeling.
